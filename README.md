# Scorer
GitHub scorer

## What is it?
Scorer is based around the idea of 'scoring' team efficency based on their number of changes. You can measure this by looking at the number of PRs a team has performed over a time period.

Uber have something similar to this, and they anonymise the data then use it internally to help them see what teams/regions ***may*** need help. It's not a definite metric, it is just suggestive and needs interpreting based on who/where is under review.

It shouldn't be used against individuals as otherwise it ends up being gamified and cheated.

## How?

Given access to an organisation, this tool can review all the users and their PRs within the organisation. It needs further detail in teams and regions however to be useful.
